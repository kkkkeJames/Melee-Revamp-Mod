# MeleeRevamp
Melee Revamp is a mod in development that aims at reworking attack ways of vanilla melee weapons. This mod reworks the attacking ways of melee weapons so they attack more smoothly, have better visual effects, and serves as better weapons compare to weapons of other damage types. This mod also adds "sword power" to each reworked melee weapon, which is a resource that can boost damage (and trigger special moves in future versions) if weapons are used properly.
This mod is under development. Currently, only 8 pre-hardmode metal bar swords are being revamped. This mod plans to rework most melee weapons (mostly swords, but also include weapons like spears, flails and others) and add more moves so different weapons have entirely different attack patterns.
This mod is still in beta test. 
TODO:
1. Optimize the state machine structure (remove redundant variables and structures to make it more readable)
2. Add more attacking moves as states
3. Rework the 4 materials of Nights Edge and some other starter melee swords
4. Look into the revamp of starter spears to make them throwable
